# NestJS and Prisma Learning Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the NestJS and Prisma learning project! In this project, you will be working with NestJS, a powerful and extensible Node.js framework, and Prisma, a modern database toolkit.

## Project Overview

### Entities

- **User:** Represents a user in the system.
- **Post:** Describes a post made by a user, with associated comments and tags.
- **Profile:** Provides additional information about a user.
- **Comment:** Represents a comment made by a user on a post.
- **Tag:** Describes a tag associated with posts.

### Relationships

- **OneToOne:** User and Profile have a one-to-one relationship.
- **ManyToOne:** Comment has many-to-one relationships with both User and Post.
- **ManyToMany:** Tag and Post share a many-to-many relationship.

## Task Overview

Your task is to implement the following features:

### User Registration and Profile

1. Create an API endpoint for user registration.
2. Implement a OneToOne relationship between User and Profile. When a user registers, a corresponding profile should be created.

### Post and Comments

3. Implement an API endpoint to create a new post with comments.
4. Ensure a ManyToOne relationship between Comment and both User and Post.

### Tagging Posts

5. Create an API endpoint to associate tags with posts.
6. Implement a ManyToMany relationship between Tag and Post. A post can have multiple tags, and a tag can be associated with multiple posts.

### Retrieve User's Posts

7. Implement an API endpoint to retrieve all posts of a specific user.
8. Utilize the OneToMany relationship between User and Post.

### GraphQL Integration (Optional)

9. If you've explored GraphQL, integrate the GraphQL module into your NestJS application.
10. Expose queries and mutations to interact with the different entities and their relationships.

## Note

- Ensure proper error handling and validation in your API endpoints.
- Test the implemented features using tools like Swagger or by writing automated tests.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate Swagger for API documentation and testing.
2. Explore GraphQL integration if not done already.
3. Add comprehensive test cases to ensure the functionality of your application.
